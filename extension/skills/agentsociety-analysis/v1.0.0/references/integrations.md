# External Tools & Skills by Stage

Invoke these **during** the matching stage — do not only cite them in references.

Skill paths assume workspace sync to `.claude/skills/` (VS Code extension preset). Bundled support lives under `.claude/skills/agentsociety-analysis/support/`.

## Experience epilogue (Stage 6 Part C — non-blocking)

Run after `validate-synthesis` PASS **and** `research-pipeline update-stage analysis completed`. Details: `references/experience-memory.md`. `gate-status` / `run-loop` return `epilogue` when workspace + hypothesis releases are ready.

```text
1. Chat with user (conversation prompts in epilogue)
2. record-feedback          (if user answered)
3. draft-reflection
4. Walk user through draft — edit if needed
5. record-reflection        (reviewed payload)
6. review-reflection        (harness safety check)
7. promote-reflection       (lessons + method_recipes)
8. promote-reflection --include-preferences   ONLY after explicit user OK
9. memory-context           (verify what next intake will see)
```

Do not skip the user conversation silently. Preferences without user confirmation must not be promoted. Skipping promotion does not block pipeline completion.

## Next pipeline stage

After step 9, `research-pipeline where-am-i` should show analysis completed. User intent for paper → invoke **paper-toolkit** plugin (external); requires `presentation/` reports + `papers/literature_index.json`.

## Lightweight paths

| User intent                               | Minimum path                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick data check only                     | Stage 1 frame + Stage 2 explore → stop (no attestation for later phases if user declines)           |
| Report without cross-hypothesis synthesis | Not supported — Stage 6 still required; single-hypothesis scope in `synthesis_scope_hypothesis_ids` |
| Failed / empty run                        | Stage 2 attestation `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` + document `blocking_reason`; do not fabricate claims      |

## Office export (Stage 5+, on request)

| Skill  | Use                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pdf`  | Share static PDF of report or merge figures |
| `docx` | Word version for collaborators              |
| `pptx` | Slide deck from findings section            |
| `xlsx` | Large appendix tables                       |

Gate deliverables remain MD + HTML under `presentation/` — exports are copies.
