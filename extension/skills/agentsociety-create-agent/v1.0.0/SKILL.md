description: Use when creating or revising a custom agent type, when an experiment needs an agent class that does not yet exist in the workspace, or when the agent design must be sized against a simulation budget.
---

# Create Agent

Add Python modules under **`custom/agents/`** relative to the **workspace root** (the directory that contains `custom/`). The backend scanner loads every `*.py` under that tree **except** paths under an **`examples/`** segment.

- Nested folders are allowed (e.g. `custom/agents/research/lab_agent.py`).
- Prefer **one primary agent class per file** for clarity; the scanner can surface multiple `AgentBase` subclasses in the same file if you define them.

## When to Use
- User asks to create a new agent type (e.g., "student agent", "donor agent")
- Designing agent behaviors or implementing AgentBase/PersonAgent subclasses
- experiment-config needs an agent class that does not yet exist in the workspace
- Extending an existing agent with custom logic
- The simulation size, step budget, or runtime budget needs to shape the agent design

**Do NOT use when:**
- You only need to discover existing agents (use scan-modules)
- The task is about environment modules, not agents

## Quick Reference

Use the Python interpreter from `.env`. See `CLAUDE.md` for setup.

## Scale Budget

Collect the simulation scale budget before locking the agent design:

- target agent count or range
- expected step budget
- runtime or compute budget
- preferred complexity tier, such as lean, balanced, or rich

If the budget is still open, ask a single round of clarifying questions. Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs and a recommendation, then choose the option that keeps per-agent logic proportional to the simulation size.

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Validate agent file | `$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file /path/to/workspace/custom/agents/my_agent.py` |
| Validate (JSON output) | `$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file ... --json` |
| Register | VS Code: **Scan Custom Modules** (and **Test Custom Modules** if needed) |

## Workflow

```dot
digraph create_agent_flow {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#E8F4FD"];
    intake [label="gather requirements"];
    design [label="choose base class\nand state model"];
    generate [label="implement code\nfrom templates"];
    validate [label="run validator\nand self-check"];
    register [label="scan custom modules"];

    intake -> design -> generate -> validate -> register;
}
```

## Stage Notes

- `stages/intake.md`: gather requirements and clarify open questions
- `stages/design.md`: choose base class, workspace, profile, and state shape
- `stages/generate.md`: implement code with `artifacts/templates.md`
- `stages/validate.md` and `checklists/compatibility.md`: final validation

## Base Class

| Class | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `AgentBase` | Simple behavior, games/benchmarks, you manage state yourself |
| `PersonAgent` | Skills, tool loops, workspace, checkpoint/WAL, heavier runtime |

Required and optional methods, LLM/env APIs, config: use **`references/agent-base-interface.md`** as the single detailed source (avoids duplicating it here).

## Environment and Profile

- Env call patterns: `references/environment-interaction.md`
- **Common pitfalls (read before writing `ask_env` code): `references/pitfalls.md`**
- Profile fields: `references/profile-design.md`
- In-repo examples: `references/examples.md`

## Custom Skills

By default an agent loads skills from `<workspace>/custom/skills/` plus any
environment-module skill dirs. You can also point an agent at skills stored
**anywhere** on disk — useful for sharing a skill library across agents or
mounting skills from outside the workspace:

- **Declarative** (recommended): add `extra_skill_paths` to the agent's
  `init_config.json` (written verbatim to `config.json`, read back on restore):
  ```json
  { "extra_skill_paths": ["/shared/skills", "research/skills"] }
  ```
- **Programmatic**: `agent.discover_skill_sources(env, extra_skill_paths=[...])`

Each entry is a root of skill subdirectories (same layout as `custom/skills`);
relative paths resolve against the workspace root. The default scan is unchanged
when omitted. Full details: `references/agent-base-interface.md` → *Skill sources*.

### Skill directory layout and required frontmatter

Each skill is a subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file. **`SKILL.md` must
start with a YAML frontmatter block** delimited by `---` and declare at least
`name` and `description`:

```
custom/skills/
└─ my-skill/
   └─ SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: One-line summary the agent sees in the skill catalog before activation. Keep it specific.
---

# My Skill

Body — only injected into the prompt AFTER the agent activates this skill.
```

The `name`/`description` are the **only** catalog fields the model sees at
selection time. A `SKILL.md` without frontmatter is silently registered with an
empty `description`, so the agent effectively never discovers or selects it.
Rules:

- `name`: stable skill id; lowercase kebab-case is conventional.
- `description`: concise, action-oriented; mention what it does and that env
  tools are reached via `ask_env` when the skill drives an environment.
- `script` / `hooks` are optional frontmatter keys.
- Keep the body's `ask_env` instructions stable (template + `variables`) so env
  router cache hits across agents.

## Validation

```bash
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file /path/to/workspace/custom/agents/my_agent.py
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file ... --json
```

The script checks: AST shows a **direct** base named **`AgentBase`** or **`PersonAgent`**,
the three required abstracts (`to_workspace`, `ask`, `step`) are **`async def`**,
the module imports, and the class is not abstract. That is **stricter**
than **Scan Custom Modules**: the scanner now verifies real overrides of
`to_workspace`/`ask`/`step`, arg-less construction, and non-empty
`description()`/`init_description()` (via `build_agent_scan_diagnostic`), but it
does **not** enforce `async def` or a direct base class — this validator does.

`AgentBase` already defines default `description()` and `init_description()` methods;
overriding both is still recommended for real modules.

For the full human checklist see `stages/validate.md` and `checklists/compatibility.md`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Putting runtime state in construction code | Put state setup in `restore(self, workspace_path, service_proxy)` and persist state through `to_workspace` |
| Reusing `run_react_loop` without overriding `build_react_messages` | The base raises `NotImplementedError`. Always override `build_react_messages` when you call `run_react_loop` |
| Using intermediate base classes that fail the AST validation rule | Ensure direct inheritance from `AgentBase` or `PersonAgent`, or follow the MRO note in `stages/validate.md` |
| Forgetting to make required methods async | `to_workspace` / `ask` / `step` must all be `async def` |
| Not running the validator after creating the agent | Always run `.agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file ...` as the final step |
| Adding files under an `examples/` path | The scanner skips any path containing an `examples/` segment; place files directly under `custom/agents/` |
| Phrasing `ask_env` message as a Python call literal (`"tool(arg=val)"`) | Use natural language `"Please call tool_name() using <args> from ctx['variables'] ..."` — see `references/pitfalls.md` P2 |
| Using `template_mode=True` for `readonly=False` writes without checking idempotency / argument-name collisions | Default to `template_mode=False` for writes; only enable when the env tool is verified idempotent AND argument names don't collide with other writes — see `references/pitfalls.md` P3 |
| Calling the same write tool more than once per `step()` "to be safe" | Trust the `status` return; retry only on `fail`/`error` — see `references/pitfalls.md` P4 |
| Shipping a `SKILL.md` without YAML frontmatter (or with empty `description`) | Always start `SKILL.md` with `---` frontmatter declaring `name` + `description`; without it the skill registers with an empty description and is never selected — see *Custom Skills* above |

## Subagent Delegation

Stages 2-3 (design + code generation) can consume significant context. Delegate to subagents when:

- The agent design involves complex logic (multi-step reasoning, state machines, nested tool calls)
- The profile has many custom fields that need careful mapping
- The hypothesis requires non-trivial agent behaviors tied to experiment variables
- The target simulation size is high enough that the design needs a leaner reasoning or state strategy
- You are in a long research pipeline session and context is at a premium

**How to delegate (planner → generator → reviewer):**

1. Complete Stage 1 yourself (intake). Collect user requirements.
2. **Planner**: Dispatch a subagent with the user requirements + hypothesis context, instructing it to read `subagent-prompts/planner.md` and follow it. The planner produces a structured DesignSpec JSON — what methods to implement, what state to track, what persistence is needed, all tied to the hypothesis.
3. **Generator**: Dispatch a subagent with the DesignSpec, instructing it to read `subagent-prompts/implementer.md` and follow it. The generator writes code from the spec.
4. **Reviewer**: Dispatch a subagent with the file path + DesignSpec, instructing it to read `subagent-prompts/reviewer.md` and follow it. The reviewer checks the code against the spec with fresh context.
5. After all subagents return, run `$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py create-agent --file ...` yourself and fix any remaining issues from the reviewer report.

**Do NOT delegate:** simple agents that inherit from `AgentBase` with trivial `ask`/`step` overrides. For those, do Stages 1-4 yourself.

## Pipeline Position

**Optional helpers:** scan-modules (to check existing agents before creating a new one)
**Successors:** experiment-config (when custom agents are needed)
**Required Sub-Skills:** None

Called by experiment-config as an optional branch when the required agent class does not already exist.
