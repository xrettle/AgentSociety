# Research Pipeline

Orchestrates the AgentSociety research workflow. Determines which skill to invoke based on the current workspace state and user intent.

## Overview

The research pipeline is a revision-capable workflow: **literature search → hypothesis → experiment config → run → analysis → paper**, with explicit reroutes back to the smallest sufficient earlier stage. After a draft exists, `paper-review` can perform an optional robust author-side mock review using three parallel independent reviewers and a separate evidence-verifying MetaReview agent, then advise which earlier stage to revisit. The review remains read-only; the user or controlling coding agent closes the feedback loop by explicitly applying an accepted route through `research-pipeline reroute`. Supporting skills (scan-modules, create-agent, create-env-module, web-research, datasets) branch off the main trunk at specific points.

## Scale Planning Gate

Before entering `experiment-config`, `create-agent`, or `create-env-module`, confirm the simulation scale budget:

- target agent count or range
- expected step budget
- acceptable runtime or compute budget
- preferred complexity tier, such as lean, balanced, or rich

If any of these are missing, ask one round of clarifying questions first. Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs and a recommendation, then route into the appropriate skill once the budget is fixed.

## Dataset Gate

If the task may depend on external data, treat dataset access as a first-class branch rather than an afterthought.

- Use `agentsociety-use-dataset` to search, inspect, and download datasets from the platform.
- If no suitable dataset exists locally or remotely, surface that gap before continuing with experiment design.
- Use `agentsociety-create-dataset` when the work needs packaging, validation, upload, or publishing of a dataset.
- If local files should be shared or reused, guide the user through dataset upload rather than folding the files into experiment config by hand.

## Quick Reference

At the beginning of a new session or resumption, run:

```bash
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py research-pipeline where-am-i --json
```

This reads `.agentsociety/progress.json` to determine the current stage. If the file does not exist, fall back to file-existence detection and then bootstrap tracking with `init`.

## Git Checkpoint Discipline

Every pipeline transition must be persisted with an explicit git commit. Hook-based auto-commit approaches are unreliable — always commit manually.

### Workspace Initialization

When bootstrapping a new workspace with `research-pipeline init`:

```bash
# 1. Init the workspace directory if not already a git repo
git init
# 2. Create progress tracking
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py research-pipeline init --topic "TOPIC"
# 3. Initial commit
git add -A && git commit -m "init: bootstrap research pipeline"
```

### Stage Transitions

After **every** call to `research-pipeline update-stage`, commit the current iteration's changes:

```bash
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py research-pipeline update-stage STAGE STATUS
git add -A && git commit -m "pipeline: STAGE → STATUS"
```

For example:

```bash
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py research-pipeline update-stage literature_search completed
git add -A && git commit -m "pipeline: literature_search → completed"
```

Apply an accepted review or analysis reroute with the same checkpoint discipline:

```bash
$PYTHON_PATH .agentsociety/bin/ags.py research-pipeline reroute experiment_config \
  --reason "MetaReview found that the control cannot identify the claimed effect" \
  --source-artifact paper/reviews/acl-arr-review-r1.md
git add -A && git commit -m "pipeline: reroute to experiment_config"
```

### Rules

- If `git` is not initialized in the workspace, run `git init` first.
- Commit messages follow the pattern: `pipeline: STAGE → STATUS`.
- Use `git add -A` to capture all changes produced by the current stage.
- Do **not** rely on git hooks (pre-commit, post-commit, etc.) for this — they are unreliable in this context. Commit explicitly.

## Entry Conditions

Use `where-am-i --json` whenever the current stage is unclear.

- If `.agentsociety/progress.json` exists, trust `current_stage` as the primary routing signal.
- If the file is missing, infer the stage from workspace artifacts, then initialize progress tracking.
- If the current stage already has a failed status, route to the owning skill for repair rather than restarting the pipeline.
- If the current stage has `needs_revision`, route to the owning skill with the active reroute reason and source artifact as required context.
- If the work depends on simulation size or runtime budget and those values are missing, resolve the scale planning gate before routing onward.

| `current_stage` | Route to Skill |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `literature_search` | literature-search |
| `hypothesis` | hypothesis |
| `experiment_config` | experiment-config |
| `run_experiment` | run-experiment |
| `analysis` | analysis |
| `generate_paper` | paper-toolkit |

Post-paper review is routed by user intent rather than `current_stage`: when a complete draft exists and the user asks for an internal review, venue score, or revision-stage advice, invoke `agentsociety-paper-review`. For PDF input, prepare one frozen page-aware intake and pass the same text, layout, and page renders to every agent; stop when its quality gate fails. A normal result requires three isolated reviewer subagents running concurrently followed by a separately spawned MetaReview subagent. The review bundle is advisory and must not update `.agentsociety/progress.json`; only the user or controlling coding agent may subsequently accept a stage-valued reroute and call `research-pipeline reroute`.

## Iterative Cycles

- **Analysis → Hypothesis**: results may refine or revise the hypothesis
- **Experiment-config → Create-agent/Create-env-module**: missing modules trigger creation
- **Experiment-config → Scan-modules**: names can be confirmed when discovery is needed
- **Run → Config**: failed validation or execution loops back to config fixes
- **Paper → Review → Earlier stage**: paper-review emits advisory reroutes; the user or controlling coding agent decides whether to apply one with `research-pipeline reroute`

`reroute` is the only supported backward transition. It:

1. rejects forward jumps;
2. increments `workspace.revision_round`;
3. changes the accepted target and already-completed downstream stages to `needs_revision` without deleting artifacts;
4. resets stale verification and stage metadata for those stages;
5. records the reason, source artifact, previous stage-state snapshots, and invalidated stages in the append-only `transitions` log;
6. keeps `active_reroute` until all invalidated stages are completed or explicitly skipped.

Do not apply `human_decision` or `none` as stages. Pause for accountable input on `human_decision`; leave pipeline state unchanged for `none`. When several review routes exist, apply the earliest accepted stage once—the normal forward flow will revisit its invalidated downstream stages.

## Persistence Files

| File | Git | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| `.agentsociety/progress.json` | Committable | Stage tracker with status, revision round, active reroute, attempts, and append-only transition history |

## Hard Constraints

- Never run analysis before `run-experiment` produces `run/replay/_schema.json`
- Always run `experiment-config check` before `run-experiment`
- `paper-toolkit` requires analysis reports to exist
- `paper-review` requires a complete draft, a passing shared PDF intake when applicable, and a valid 3-reviewer ensemble before MetaReview; it writes only the reserved review bundle and never updates pipeline stage or executes reroute advice
- Apply backward movement only through `research-pipeline reroute`; do not edit `current_stage` or downstream statuses by hand
- Keep the controlling agent as the single writer of `progress.json`; subagents return artifacts and must not perform pipeline transitions
- Always call `research-pipeline update-stage` after completing a pipeline stage
- Always git commit after `research-pipeline update-stage` — see **Git Checkpoint Discipline**
- On workspace init, run `git init` (if needed) followed by an initial commit
- Do not rely on git hooks for auto-commit; commit explicitly after every stage transition
