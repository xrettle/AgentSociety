"""Tests for the distributed trace sink and the JsonlTraceWriter span API.

Trace is now distributed and lock-free: each writer holds its own
``ShardedAppendSink`` and appends directly via ``os.write(O_APPEND)`` into the
256 shard files keyed by ``trace_id[:2]`` (no central Ray actor). Oversized
string values are capped so every record fits below ``PIPE_BUF`` and a single
``write`` is atomic across concurrent writers.
